BrainBread FGD Entities
=======================
Thanks to Jez for this!

BB_SPAWN_ZOMBIE (POINT ENTITY)

» Zombie spawn points (bb_spawn_zombie): the best idea is to set quite a few around,
  and set the amount of live children to 3 at the maximum.

» Marine Spawn points (bb_spawn_zombie): To create ally grunts, use the same entity
  as the zombies, except change the monster to spawn to : monster_hgrunt for a normal
  SMG carrying grunt or monster_hgrunt_shotgun for a shotgun carrying grunt. 

It is usually best to only place a few marines at key points otherwise they will just
over run the zombies which isnt really how the mod should play i dont think :S 


BB_OBJECTIVES (POINT ENTITY)

» Mission Objectives (bb_objectives): Place this entity anywhere were you want to spawn
  a fred or a case (you can select in the case if either only the case or fred (or both)
  should spawn at this place, the best idea is to place lots of these around the maps key
  areas to vary the gameplay from round to round. Another entities which is linked to this
  one is the...


BB_MISSION_ZONE (FUNC_BRUSH ENTITY)

» ...BB_MISSION_ZONE one. This is needed as a place to take the case to once the player
  has picked it up. To create one of these, create a large brush where people will run
  into with it. The best place for this is back at the main base of somewhere like that.
  Once its created, tie it to the entity bb_mission_zone. This brush will then be invisible
  in game and is the return place for the case. Its also a good idea to place a...


PE_RADAR_MARK (POINT ENTITY)

» ...pe_radar_mark in the middle of this brush, as this will show up as a white dot on the
  radar, giving the player a clue where to go to drop the case off.

===========================================================================================

MAP ENDINGS

» Map Endings: This is possibly the most tricky part of mapping for BB. It took me a while
  to figure this out. Place a bb_escapeair somewhere on your map, preferably in the air,
  and give it a name, for example bh1. Now place some waypoints, bb_waypoint. Name these
  wp1, wp2 etc. Set the first stop target to wp1, then on that set the next stop target to
  wp2 etc. until you get to your last wp and set that to wp1 again so it will loop. This
  will make the blackhawk fly to these waypoints during the game when it is idle.
  Now create a LARGE brush, and tie it to the entity bb_escape_final. This will also be
  invisible once in game, but make sure that in anytime during the game, the blackhawk
  will not come into contact with this brush. Now place a waypoint above this location,
  one where you want the blackhawk to fly to once it has been called. You can set up a
  chain of waypoints such as before or just a single one. Label the first waypoint of the
  chain fin, or the waypoint you want it to fly to once the blackhawk has been called fin.
  Now on the bb_escapeair entity, under rescue route start, set the target to fin or
  whatever you called the rescue waypoint. Now your backhawk is setup, you have to set up
  the means of calling it. Create a fake radio out of brushs, make sure u have a small bit
  of it which you can tie to a func_button entity. Tie this button part to a func_button,
  and set it up like you normally would a button but set its target to bh1 or whatever you
  called your blackhawk. Now ingame on the last mission, after you push the button the
  blackhawk should now come to the last waypoint. But you still have to add markers so the
  player knows where to go.

» Markers: bb_funk add this to the position of your custom created radio. Add 
  bb_escape_radar to the position of your last blackhawk waypoint. This entity tells the
  player where to go after the blackhawk has been called.

MAPENDING (SIMPLE)
If you active the "always active" flag in the bb_escape_final ent you'll always escape if
you reach this zone. You can combine those things with your own mission. Seal the escape
zone until the last mission has been completed (for example a door etc). After the door
has been opened you are abel to escape.

If you don't put in an Escapezone the round will be completed after the last mission.


.TSK Missionfile
================
To get the missions to work, you must include a .tsk file with the same filename as your
map. If you open a file such as bb_heavensgate.tsk it just has random random random random.
This is telling the map what type of missions. 

random ---> Either fetch the case, kill fred or kill a special amount of zombies; the last
	    random mission always activates the escape mission, so you should always put
	    random at the end of your tsk.file if you want ppl to escape!

fred   ---> This triggers the fred mission

case   ---> This triggers the case mission

carnage --> This triggers the "kill amount of zombies" mission; the amount is related to
            the player on the server

Example:
Your .tsk file includes the following content:

random - -
fred - -
case - -
carnage - -
random - -

The first "random" triggers a random mission (fred, case or carnage).
The fred triggers the "kill fred" mission AFTER the first mission has been completed!
The case triggers the "fetch the case" mission AFTER you killed fred.
The carnage triggers the "kill amount of zombies" mission AFTER you completed the casemission!
The last "random" triggers the "search the radio and order the helicopter" mission!


"-" and "-" are targets for entities... example:

fred door1 door2
means, that with the beginning of the fred mission "door1" will be triggered and as soon as
the fred mission is completed the entity "door2" will be triggered.

You are also able to create your own mapmissions (take a look at the end of this document)!


Misc.
=====
Zombies are VERY restricted in BB, so i reccomend leaving escape routes from WHEREVER you
have placed zombie spawns. Zombies CANNOT do the following:

Crouch
Climb ladders

These are very important factors when creating a map, as if you are having multiple layers,
you must include ramps to each section, and these have to be full access ramps as the
zombies cant crouch. This was the worst problem when i was creating my map.
