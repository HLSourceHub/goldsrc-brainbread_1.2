                        --- CHAPTER 2: RISING OF THE DARK SUN ---

Great! You managed to escape from the inner city of NEW HEAVENS CYBERGATE... but you still
have to pass the "DARK SUN" industrial district. The hacker Nietzsche is still around
somewhere to help you on your oddysee through this fallen metropolis...
Your final goal would be the "Cybercon Biodome", which is located next to this district.
There you'll get some answers and the access information for the airship at the Cybercon
building.

A) You're starting with your group in front of the elevator. Nietzsche still helps you!
   An agent lost a case with important information and codes, including the keycode the
   sealed door to the next area. Bring it back to the mission zone, so that you could
   give Nietzsche access to those codes.   

B) After Nietzsche has opened the doors move on to the next area!

C) Nietzsche will need a couple of minutes for the next doors. Hold your position for two
   minutes!

D) Move on to the next area...

E) You have to pass the corridor in order the reach the next section of this district.
   Nietzsche tries to give you access to your mission zone... 
   (so you don't have to pass the whole map...)

F) Nietzsche will need two minutes for the next door. Hold your position and kill as
   much zombies as you can!

G) Move on to the next section!

H) Oh no! Freds twinbrother "Hans Fred" (a huge german guy) awaits you at the end of
   this section. Kill him, so that Nietzsche could open the elevator doors!

I) Move to the elevator and escape to the upper part of the town... "Cybercon Biodome"!
