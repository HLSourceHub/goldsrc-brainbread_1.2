              --- BRAINBREAD --- OFFICIAL SCIENCE FICTION CAMPAIGN ---
                        --- CHAPTER 3: CYBERCON BIODOME ---

You finally reached the "Cybercon Biodome", a high tech greenhouse. You'll need more
information about the horde, Cybercon and the access codes to the roof of the Cybercon
building. Those information have been stored in a case, which you'll find in front of
the mainframe. It seems that a scientist wanted to escape with this case... but he
failed.
You need to fight your way through the biodome in order to reach the backside of the
huge Cybercon building. Small groups of rebels and militia forces still help you on
your mission.

A) Head to the mainframe control terminal of the biodome and bring the case to the
   mission zone. The hacker Nietzsche will need these information to open certain
   parts of the dome.

B) After Nietzsche has opened the doors move on to the next area!

C) Kill a specific amount of zombies... Nietzsche will open the doors after you've
   calmed down the situation a littlebit.

D) Fight your way through the corridor and move on to the main hall of the biodome.

E) Argh... this really sucks... Cybercon cloned Fred! Kill him for the LAST time!

F) Move on to the next room... obviously a private chamber of some Cybercon scientist.

G) Nietzsche needs two minutes for the next door. Hold your position and kill as
   much zombies as you can!

H) Move to the exit and escape. Next to the biodome is the production facility of 
   Cybercon, so your target isn't that far from here.
