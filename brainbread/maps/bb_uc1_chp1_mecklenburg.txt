It was in the early morning when the chaos started: roaming hordes of bloodthirsty
men ran through the city, killing everybody at sight. U.S. military forces moved into
the area to rescue as many as possible. They soon had to realize that the only way
to stop the cannibal hordes was to shoot them.
Now the whole town is sealed and the only way out is the military! They won't bring
the effort to save you, though, if you don't return the favour. You're one of a few
survivors who made it to a military camp. In order to escape you've to work with the
soldiers. So here are your tasks...

A) Retrieve the case with valuable information about this epidemy and the codes for
   the blocked doorway!

B) Kill some zombies to calm down the situation...

C) Search and kill FRED, a mutated zombie. You should be able to escape from this area
   after his final death...
