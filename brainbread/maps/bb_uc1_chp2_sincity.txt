You just escaped from the town via helicopter. To refuel the helicopter you land in a
small part of the town at the next morning. But as soon as you arrive, you notice that
nothing seems to be calm or safety...
The inhabitants don't even say "Hello!" or something... They just shout "Braaaaaaiiins!"
or "Fleeeeesh!" and they seem to loose a lot of blood. The other problem is, that the
only exit out of the village has been blocked by boulder, wood and other
junk. You decide to help the U.S. Army to get out of that creepy place!

A) Kill some zombies to prove your will and ability.

B) Retrieve the case with valuable information about this epidemy.

C) Search and kill FRED, a mutated zombie. The army wants to analyze its DNA.

D) Call the BlackHawk and escape from Sin City!
