The night comes up. At first you thought you got a great deal on a leaving the city. You
made it to a small cottage at a cemetery, but then you also heard the reports about strange
deaths and people behavior on the radio, then the military came and the nightmare goes on!

A) This area is MUCH more difficult than most other areas, try to think before you go
   rushing to your doom.

B) Find out where the strange deaths are coming from...

C) You may have to arm yourself! Of course your pistols will scare away the average
   trespasser, but you have a stronger weapon hidden at home in case you needed it...

D) If you need more firepower, the local gun store has a variety of weapons you can look
   at, while the best weapons are hidden!

E) Finally... try to escape from this place.
