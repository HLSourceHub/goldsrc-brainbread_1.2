                --- BRAINBREAD --- CUSTOM USER CAMPAIGN ---
                --- CHAPTER 5:  THE LAST STAND ---

NOTE: THIS CAMPAIGN AND ALL MAPS HAVE NOT BEEN CREATED BY THE IRONOAK TEAM! WE ARE NOT
          RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONTENT. THIS MAP HAS BEEN CREATED BY MALAKILI!

Story: The zombies have pursued what remains of your squad all the way to your next rally
point out in the desert in front of the city. It's deep at night. As of this moment, they
have you completely surrounded. There's no hope of escape anymore, so the only thing you
can do now is take as many with you as possible before you're overwhelmed.

Armaments: M16, Minigun, USP and spare ammo are on crates in the 
center, the AK and Flamethrower are laying on the ground, and the 
Benelli shotgun, Stoner sniper rifle, and Double Uzis are laying 
on the sandbags.

A) Hold 'em off, men!

B) Escape from this place to the other cemetary!
