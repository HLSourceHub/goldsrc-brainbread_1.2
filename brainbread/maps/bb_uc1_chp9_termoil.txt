You stay in the mansion until the morning sun rises. You heard via TV of a rescue
helicopter that could bring you out of here, so you left the building.
After a few minutes you reached the landinge zone, but zombies are in the streets and
there's only one way out of here. The Blackhawk wont come down until your job is done...
Zombies ... lots of zombies, and again a REALLY big one! The zombies have found shelter
in a large crater dug from an explosion they caused. So make sure to have some-one
covering your back whilst you go in, and dont forget to make advantage of the higher
ground to snipe some zombie head!

A) Retrieve the case with valuable information about this epidemy and the codes for
   the only working radio station in the city in order to get contact with the rescue
   helicopter.

B) Kill some zombies to calm down the situation...

C) Search and kill FRED, a mutated zombie. The army wants to analyze its DNA.

D) Use the only functionable radio in town to order the helicopter and - finally - escape.
