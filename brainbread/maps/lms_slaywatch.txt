BRAINBREAD ---  SLAYWATCH  ---  LAST MAN STANDING MODE

Don't join the horde! With every infected oponent the remaining uninfected
will get a bonus of 20% hitpoints, speed and damage.

The LAST MAN STANDING wins!

Your mission as a human:
Some survivors and soldiers are trapped in the mall. They built up some 
barricades before the horde entered the building, but the only way out is via
helicopter! The Army won't bring the effort to save you, though, if you don't
return the favor. So here are your tasks:

A) Defend the barricades for a couple of minutes.

B) Kill some zombies to calm down the situation.

C) Search and kill FRED, a mutated zombie. The army wants to analyze its DNA.

D) Retrieve the case with valuable information about this epidemy.

E) Use the radio at the barricades to order the helicopter and - finally - escape.
